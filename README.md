# Evaluating-the-Global-Impact-of-Renewable-Energy-Adoption-on-CO-Emissions
#This repository contains the full analysis code for my MSc dissertation project at Sheffield Hallam University:
“Evaluating the Global Impact of Renewable Energy Adoption on CO₂ Emissions (2000–2020)”.

The analysis investigates how renewable energy adoption affects CO₂ emissions across more than 150 countries, addressing gaps in the literature such as developed-country bias, the role of economic moderators, the rebound effect, and alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
# Key Analyses

Data Preparation

Cleaning and merging datasets from World Bank and Kaggle.

Handling missing values and ensuring cross-country comparability.

Descriptive Statistics & Visualisation

Time-series trends in CO₂ emissions and renewable shares.

Comparisons by income group (HIC, UMIC, LMIC, LIC).

Regression Modelling

Baseline linear regression: renewables vs. emissions.

Extended models with GDP per capita, energy intensity, and climate finance as moderators.

Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) testing.

Rebound Effect Analysis

Sectoral patterns (households, transport, industry).

Macro-level rebound proxies (elasticity slopes, energy stacking).

SDG Alignment

Mapping results against SDG 7 (Affordable & Clean Energy) and SDG 13 (Climate Action).
